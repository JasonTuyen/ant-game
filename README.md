# ant-game
My source code for Sacramento State's Object Oriented Programming course, CSC 133 Spring 21. The project requirement was to create a game where a player controls a character and moves the character to checkpoints while collecting various items.

## Disclaimer

* CSC 133 is Sacramento State's Object Oriented Programming course where students learn to apply OOP principles, differnt design patterns, graphical user interfaces and more
* Project idea belongs to Sacramento State's Computer Science Department, but code was implemented and written by Jason Tuyen

## Built With

* Java
* [Codename One](https://www.codenameone.com/) for cross-platform developmenmt
* [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) 

## Demo
Coming soon!

## How-To-Play
Control your ant, avoid enemies, collect food, and navigate towards the checkpoints to win in this java based game.

To take control of the ant, you may use the on screen buttons or a keyboard. The usable control commands are:
* Accelerate - speeds up the ant's movement speed ('a' button)
* Brake - slows down the ant's movement speed ('b' button)
* Left - turns the ant's perspective towards the left ('l' button)
* Right - turns the ant's perspective towards the right ('r' button)
* Pause - pauses the game ('p' button)

## Installation Instructions

1. Download all files in src folder.
2. Use Eclipse IDE to start a new CodeName1 project.
3. Add src folder to your new project and run.

## Future Development Plans

* I'd like to make additional improvements or redesign this project someday. It's been a while since this class and I'd like to see how much I improved since then.
